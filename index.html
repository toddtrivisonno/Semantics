        <h2>Guatemala</h2>
            <p>Guatemala is easily overlooked, south of it's much larger neighbor, Mexico, and sandwiched 
                    together with many other smaller countries. And though the news will regularly tell you it's 
                    a dangerous place to be avoided, a little time there reveals it's full of wonderful, accomodating 
                    people and culture.

                <h3>Reconnecting in Guatemala</h3>
                <p>After three years avoiding each other, literally moving to different countries to do so, 
                    we reconnected in the beautiful country of Guatemala.</p>

        <h2>Germany</h2>
            <p>Germany became our first home together. After our time in Guatemala together we decided to tie 
                the knot and Megan moved with me to Germany. Looking back, we must have seemed crazy...my boss 
                did suspect I had mail-ordered a bride...but we knew what we were getting ourselves into.

            <h3>Beers and Buddys</h3>
            <p>
                Talking about Germany wouldn't be complete without talking about the great friends we 
                made while sampling Germany's finest beer halls.

            <h2>Italy</h2>
                <p>It total we lived in Italy for just over four years. We loved Germany, Guatemala, and the 
                    many places we were able to visit. But Italy was a place that we could comfortably call 
                    <mark>home</mark>.

                    And then everything changes. How you think, operate, make decisions, it all gets adjusted with the addition 
                    of our first daughter, Adelaide.
